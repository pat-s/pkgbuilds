# PKGBUILDs for [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org)

Includes control scripts for managing AUR packages (adapted from https://github.com/eli-schwartz/aurpublish).

In order to reuse this, checkout the "base" branch and add your own packages on top. Don't keep mine. ;)
An additional branch, "submodules-base", contains a previous attempt of mine. I decided I don't want to use submodules, but if you'd rather use that, feel free to take a look. :)

## How it works

Commit PKGBUILDs in named subdirectories. Export them to the AUR with the included `aurpublish` script, using the subtree push stratagem.
This preserves an independent history for third-party hosting, pull requests... ;)

## Commands

* `./setup.sh ssh`
> Append ssh-config rules for accessing the AUR.

* `./setup.sh hooks`
> Install [githooks](#hooks).

* `./aurpublish PACKAGE`
> Push PACKAGE to the AUR. With "--speedup", merges the split history back in.

* `./aurpublish -p PACKAGE`
> Pull package from the AUR (if you adopted an existing package, or have a co-maintainer).

* `./aurpublish log PACKAGE`
> View the git log of a package subtree.

* `./import-from-aur3.sh PACKAGE`
> Experimental. Download the history of a non-migrated AUR3 package, and commit it to a new subtree.

## Hooks

* pre-commit
> Warn about whitespace errors, fail if checksums don't match, and auto-generate .SRCINFO for all changed PKGBUILDs.

* prepare-commit-msg
> Prefill the commit message with a list of added/updated/deleted packages + versions (if any).

## Copyright
All PKGBUILD files in this repository are licensed under the Unlicense. IMHO they aren't unique enough to qualify for copyright, therefore I have made this explicit.
The helper scripts (aurpublish, *.sh, *.hook) used are licensed under the GPLv2 or (at your option) any later version.
